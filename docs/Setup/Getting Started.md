# How to install it?

The installation is easy but don't always click next next and install there is need some little things!

## So first up we are going to download PYTH0N

the latest version for windows 10/11 is 3.12.2 as of development of this C0URSE

> Downloading on windows 10 or later is easy as of auto detecting from your browser
> Same applies to MacOS but no need to look at your MacOS versions to pick

### For windows users
1. For windows 8/8.1/10/11 users: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)<br>
2. For windows XP/Vista/7 users: I reccommend upgrading to atleast Windows 10 because it might be hard, [Python 3.9.13 Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/)
### For Linux Users
Linux is really easy there is guide by what distro you have<br>
1. Arch Linux based: ```sudo pacman -S python3```<br>
2. Debian based (Ubuntu applies too): ```sudo apt install python3```<br>
3. RHEL based: ```sudo yum install python3``` or ```sudo dnf install python3```<br>
4. Fedora based: ```sudo dnf install python3```<br>
5. Gentoo based: ```sudo emerge dev-lang/python```<br>
and done you already have pyth0n
### For MacOS users
Basically i don't know you just download it from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)<br>
I think installation is easy **i guess**.<br>
So it's Do It Yourself

## Next step: Installing!
#### For Linux users can skip
#### For MacOS: You just press 'Continune' and Agree the license (read if you want)
#### For Windows: Be prepared it's maybe a long one (I'm not responsible for Windows 7 users)
So the installer should look like this:<br>
![Installation look on Windows 10](../assets/images/installer-look-windows.png)
> NOTE: That black painted ones are to select or click (y'know english but just for noobs or skim-readers)
Please tick/check this checkbox or else it will cause problems to get Pyth0n working
![Check these](../assets/images/installer-checks-windows.png)

Then go to install now
![Install now](../assets/images/installer-install-now-windows.png)

The installation should look like this (don't care about text after installing)
![Install progress](../assets/images/installation-install-progress-windows.png)

If installation is done then click Close
